Ilea apologized to Icy, leaving quickly before she found another mountain range where she reset her Erendar location for the third tier of Teleportation.
Setting up her formation, she imbued all of the copies with their various tasks, telling them to return here if their mana ran out or if they killed a single Daughter of Sephilon. She could resummon them once per hour, and she could return here every twelve and a half minutes.
She kept True Reconstruction and Cosmic Deconstruction here for the time being, wondering if any of the other skills had some niche usage throughout the Accords.
Fabric Alteration could likely help with building or lifting things but she didn’t trust the copy to be subtle enough to not injure anyone or destroy something. Her various heat generation copies could help with smelting things but again, safety was a concern. Perhaps they could work with the Meadow at some point, if the being agreed and provided dense stone and powerful barriers.
Any use at transportation or message delivery was no longer required with the teleportation gates and Aki’s machines, but she supposed the copies could fulfill such a requirement in other realms, should that ever become relevant.
Ilea watched the copies organize themselves with each other before they moved out, floating at a leisurely speed through the sand storm of Erendar. At least the storm itself didn’t seem to be enough to destroy them. She followed for a few minutes, the first spirits showing up soon. Normal Astrals.
She made sure to command most of the copies to only use their spells when they faced an actual Daughter of Sephilon. And so she watched as her small army swarmed the spirits, the two teleporters quickly appearing close and grappling the creatures as the others caught up. Astral explosions spread out until her swarm ripped the spirits apart piece by piece.
None of them were destroyed, even from the area blasts.
She received the kill notifications and saw her swarm move on. This is kind of terrifying to watch. Now I don’t even have to be present to eradicate a monster nest.
They soon reached their goal as a large eel like spirit descended through the storm, its skin pale blue, the being at least two hundred meters long as it twirled downwards, a single bright eye set into its mouthless head. The eye glowed before a bright beam lashed out and burned past the first teleporter, and into the storm. The Daughter aimed at the reappearing being of ash when a beam of heat burned into its long body, the many flying ash copies spreading out.
Ilea saw the aura users and fighters fly close, latching on to the long creature, punching and cutting with their bodies made of ash as the Teleportation and perception users hovered close to the spirit’s head, attracting its attention.
The offensive ranged spell users were hovering as far away as they could. Pyroclastic Flow, Volcanic Source, and Fabric Alteration, protected by her Sunbound Creation, Ash Scale Armor, Catalyst Core, and Framework Disruption. She assumed the latter would be more useful teleporting enemy projectiles than trying to attack itself.
The Daughter turned to face the direction where the beam had come from but turned again to face those now clinging to its long body. An astral beam flashed out and evaporated one of the ash copies before the Teleportation user appeared in front of the remaining beam to save the Embodiment of the Arcane user, the aura and fighting copies already drawing black blood as they dug into the creature.
Ilea watched as the spirit’s head froze in the air, the Fabric Alteration copy floating with one hand stretched out. In the next moment, a single lance of ash rushed out from the copy next to it, punching through the stationary head with a single violent burst. A beam of heated fires followed, setting the head alight as the other copies continued to rip into the Daughter’s body.
She smiled when a notification popped up within her mind.
‘ding’ ‘You have defeated [Heliae – Daugher of Sephilon – lvl 1620]’ 
Now the moment of truth, she watched as her copies kept the creature in the air, a single copy flying in from behind even the offensive ranged group. It lit up like a bright flare within the storm, Ilea blinking her eyes as she watched the distant Primordial Flame. She held her breath as the remains were set alight, her copies retreating just before the fires reached them, continuing their attacks until the last moment.
The burning spirit descended and her copies followed, the Primordial Flame wielder running out of health before it could set the entire length of the Daughter alight, stopping the attack right before it would have disintegrated itself.
And still, the fires clung to the spirit and slowly burned away what remained. The other copies now swarmed the remains of the spirit and ripped it apart while the fires consumed its form.
It took some time in the end, far more than she would’ve required herself, especially for a spirit at such a low level. And still, the copies won, having lost only a few of their own.
‘ding’ ‘You have killed [Heliae – Daugher of Sephilon – lvl 1620]’
Ilea smiled as she watched the formation turn away and fly back towards the mountain range she had chosen as their base, knowing the Primordial Flame user had used up its resources. She didn’t get any level ups from the kill, and she was pretty sure this method wasn’t useful against the higher leveled Daughters, but it worked.
The moon needed clearing, and while she enjoyed fighting challenging foes, spending weeks and months killing low level Daughters sounded tedious at best. If her ash could do it in her absence, that was more than welcome. One Daughter for every hour, if they managed to win. But one fewer spirit was one fewer spirit, plus some experience for her. And she only had to quickly come here and use her spell.
Ilea returned to the mountain range with her entourage and left to the outskirts of the Meadow’s domain with her Deconstruction and Reconstruction copies in tow.
“Hey. You know about the copies. This one can show you Cosmic Deconstruction, and this one I was thinking could go out and heal people throughout the Accords, if there is a need still,” she sent.
“I appreciate it. It will be helpful, though may I make a suggestion?”
“Shoot,” Ilea said.
“We don’t know exactly how your True Reconstruction is different from its previous iteration. Cosmic energies are entirely new and I suggest we test it first. And not on your body imbued with both astral and arcane power,” the Meadow spoke.
“Right. I mean you can have these two until their mana runs out. I’ll come back in an hour to resummon them, the rest is hunting Daughters,” she said.
“Hunting… Daughters,” the Meadow said. “You’re not even fighting them on your own anymore?”
“It’s an attempt. I was thinking I could bombard Erendar from orbit as well. With how much mana I have, coupled with limitless harmony, all the heat I can generate, and the Primordial Flame…”
“Wait. I… I don’t know what kind of energy output we’re looking at here, but your magic could alter the surface of Erendar irreversibly, let alone possible collateral damage to beings still surviving on the moon.”
Ilea scratched her cheek. “Right. That could be a problem. What if I do the same to Sephilon itself?”
“I don’t know what kind of beings are there. Just because the Daughters are named after the planet does not mean only monsters reside on it. I implore you to restrain your methods. There is no rush in dealing with Erendar.”
“Fair. Let me know if you come up with other ideas. I assume Sephilon is farther away than I think as well, might take a while to get there,” Ilea said, grinning to herself at the thought of flying to the planet of a moon. With her very own wings of ash.
“Let me know if anything comes up. Oh, and I didn’t find anything near the facility of Ker Velor. There was an old tear in the fabric but he must’ve fucked with it to prevent anyone from learning anything or using it,” she said.
“That is unfortunate, I will relay that information,” it spoke. “Did you speak to Garonoth about the threat of the Architect?”
“Not yet. The dragon I killed was his son. I don’t want to bother him for the time being. But I’ll visit again soon,” she said. “Anything else?”
“Not for now,” the Meadow sent. “Thank you for the copies.”
“Sure. Have fun with them,” Ilea said and teleported to her new anchor in Erendar.
Back out in the storm, Ilea set herself the goal to familiarize herself with the new extent of her body and her magic. She had to know how heavy she really was, had to know how fast she could travel, how much pyroclastic flow she could summon in the span of one second, ten, and a minute. She had to know how much health the Primordial Flame consumed and she had to learn to get used to her new sets of teleportation.
And then she planned to read some more. The Journey of Valdyr Ainsbane had yet to conclude after all. And she knew there were seven more volumes.

The next three days passed quickly, and Ilea got through two volumes of the book series. She wondered if the author made things up, but she remembered learning about quite a few of the creatures mentioned in the book in her lessons back with the Hand.
Her training went reasonably well. She was heavy. Heavy and fast. And her spells multiplied that by ludicrous amounts. She came to the conclusion that she should probably keep all of her auras off if she planned to enter any settlements. Not for her own sake, but there was a limit to how much she could control. One wrong step or move and someone could be dead. And she didn’t want to act like everything around her could break with a simple touch.
It felt strange, to not have the spells active at all times anymore, and she had to get used to the different stages. Walking around with no buffs active, activating her spells, and using her Fourth Tiers. Each felt like day and night compared to the last.
The spells themselves and her vast experience with all of the prior versions helped tremendously with her control, but she still felt like her new form was more made for Erendar than the Plains. With her Fourth Tier Meditation active, she even managed to dance without breaking any of the thin wooden floors the Meadow continuously provided.
She could feel her copies getting wiped out one by one, the swarm likely having encountered another Daughter above two thousand. They weren’t quite enough, but the endeavor remained worth it overall. Every second spirit more or less, they managed to take down. Even with all that, she hadn’t gained another level since, likely because there was no danger to her in the slightest. She wasn’t even there.
“You’re getting better,” the Meadow said when another floor splintered due to an incredibly slight misstep.
Ilea sighed. “This is more frustrating than your fabric puzzles.”
“At least you won’t destroy most town buildings by now.”
Ilea smiled. “Right. Just thought it would be faster.”
“Unleashing one’s power is only natural. Keeping it under perfect control requires mastery.”
“It wasn’t an issue before,” she said and tried again. “And my stats are super high.”
“You broke through a threshold with your evolutions. Now you understand how difficult it was for me not to kill you back when we used to train,” the Meadow sent.
“Don’t say that so casually,” Ilea murmured in her mind, finishing the seventh step of the dance routine without breaking the wood. She rejoiced with a fist pump, the movement sending a wide crack through the floor board. Fuck. “Again.”

_______________________________

Aki watched with slight amusement as Ilea tried to dance without breaking anything, his Watcher flying nearby, assisting the Meadow in the analysis of the cosmic energies some of Ilea’s spells now held. Her copies had run out of magic, her next usage of the spell another twenty seven minutes and fourteen seconds away. All in the wasteland of the North, arcane lightning flashing down occasionally, blocked now by the barriers of the Meadow.
He also trained with a new batch of students in the Ravenhall Academy, personally present with one of his Pursuers for the evaluation process and entrance exams. He watched the students take in the distant dragon far above the snow covered city. Most of them would’ve seen Ilea bring it in, others annoyed that they had missed it. New faces, most of them young, some older, ready to join the Academy, each for their own reasons, with their own background. Some would become adventurers, would learn how to fight with their spells or spears, others would learn about healing. New classes and teachers were added depending on requests, and depending on his evaluations, and those of other faculty.
He felt joy as he saw the awe, ambition, and hope of the newcomers. At the same time he saw the blood, the grit, and tenacity of the new Sentinels he faced. Determination pushing them beyond what most could endure, or wished for. Arcane blasts shattered against his shields as he pushed them back, taking out one after the other with precise strikes that left them bleeding, some dismembered. Again he heard them moan and scream, healing their own heavy injuries after yet another loss. But not a single one complained.
“We lasted four seconds longer this time.” He heard one of the Sentinels say as a deep wound in the young man’s chest healed up.
The range of emotion was stark. Perhaps some were better prepared for the life they thought they wanted, while others were yet unknowing, or perhaps in denial. He was there for it all, and tried his best to provide guidance and training to those who would ask. Thousands of questions and requests came in every single day, collected and categorized by himself and his machine army. Some were too detailed or irrelevant to handle, while for others he hired or requested help from someone else. Requests as mundane as a missing cat in Riverwatch to the eradication of a stray demon summoned to the village of Maywatch in the far eastern Plains.
At first, adventuring jobs had reduced in quantity, most every creature quickly taken out by one of his machines or by high level adventurers, Shadows, or Sentinels that could now travel far across the lands in seconds, but the world was shifting. Few had noticed yet, but he knew that the people of the Accords and those beyond were starting to take more risks, were exploring forests long thought cursed, were digging deep into ancient mines, knowing a nearby gate could bring them to a healer in mere moments, or they ventured into ruins accompanied by his machines.
The notice boards were empty, but not because there was no work. It was because there were so many taking jobs. Opportunities were abound, and only those who pushed beyond themselves would find a place among legends such as Lilith.
He saw the darkness of near a thousand tunnels, bored into the grounds in systematic patterns by his Executioners, more created in the many facilities throughout the lands. A silent thanks he spoke to the One without Form. Without the being which had controlled this sphere and Source before, his reach would now be nowhere near as far. And still they had not been successful. Another three Executioners broke into a dungeon, one beset by a species of six legged furred monsters, not yet categorized. He fought them directly, learning of their patterns and magical abilities as he went, documenting as their likeness was shared with the Meadow and added into the newest volume of monster encyclopedias, the dungeon location marked and noted down as well whilst his Executioner killed the creatures after all attempts at diplomacy had failed.
If there were facilities created by the Architect, it was only a matter of time until Aki would find them. The question remained, how much time there was left.
Another attempt at crossing the oceans was foiled, this one near the bottom, and with a new prototype made to swim at fast speeds. He had not even heard the creature coming, his machine destroyed in an instant.
His attention moved across the lands, to a watcher near the Fire Wastes of Ash, smoke rising from dozens of battle sites. The expected exodus of Elven kind, now that the threat of the One without Form had passed, had not occurred. Or not exactly how they thought it would, their kind far more divided than they had assumed. He saw another bright explosion far in the distance, powerful enough to destroy an entire district of Ravenhall, if there were no shields at all. He didn’t know which elf it was, but considering the shock wave and the heat he measured even kilometers away, he assumed it was their Monarch, or someone close enough. Coupled with the Cerithil Hunters present once again, in the Navali Forest, the Accords had to keep more than a few eyes on the whims of the ancient rulers of the west.
If one of them set his eyes on the Plains, the collateral damage could be catastrophic, and even he doubted he had the power to stop them. But he was not alone, and with every passing day, the peoples of the Accords would grow.
Little moved in the desert of the west and south, his Watchers patrolling as he kept an eye on the Druned and Mava, still within their new and sacred Oasis. It was a tragedy that he hadn’t been there upon its creation. His attention moved farther west and deep below the mountain ranges of Olruin, where Paarah was left dormant, his machines exploring and recovering in quiet sleepless work.
He saw through the eyes of a lone Hunter Praetorian sitting in front of an old chapel near Myrefield. The skies were gray in this part of the world. Rain would soon begin to fall, and his machine was to be replaced by another in three minutes time, the energy within its core running out in the mana thin environment. He felt a surge of power when light came from within the chapel, a complex spell manifesting as he rushed back and away, green eyes focused on the happenings.
A ripple pulsed out and through the air, space magic flowing over grass and flowers. Messages were sent and spoken as he saw a single figure step out of the ruined chapel.
Rain started to fall.
            ________________________________________________________________________________  
                Chapter 895 Ancient History

Ilea appeared on the closest teleportation gate to Myrefield and spread her wings. The first teleport brought her up and out into the skies, kilometers away, the next one brought her closer, her wings moving three times until she saw the chapel in the distance.
The Praetorian was there, and right next to it a single figure she could barely make out from the distance. Aki had asked her to join, mostly to combat the obvious attempts of Helena to interfere.
Ilea focused on the ground next to Aki and used her third charge of teleportation, appearing a few meters away from the machine and instantly seeing a bright light in her domain. Too bright to make out a figure.
She felt complex arcane magic. Boundless and pure, radiant in her domain. She felt the magic increase in power as she absorbed some of it into her own, her auras up, and all of her spells ready. She could feel a slight push, purely magical in nature. Not a spell, but something more basic. As if an elemental greeted her with its chosen magic, but this was pure arcane, every fiber of magic in their surroundings adhering to this flow. The flowers and each blade of grass moving along with minuscule motions.
She had met enough strange and powerful beings to guess at its intention. A show of power, a greeting, a celebration of magic, a test perhaps, of her own power and perception. A peaceful one at that, just like the many times she had sent out her mental greetings, but this felt more universal. Ilea already planned to adopt something similar in the future instead of using words sent through telepathy. It just made sense, now that she saw and felt it.
She smiled to herself, then replied instinctively, using space itself to mimic what she had seen and felt. A ripple through the fabric that passed, knowing but not disturbing, showing, but not felt.
“Now that’s a surprise,” a deep voice spoke, calm and with a tinge of amusement.
The words made her look at what she saw instead of seeing what she knew was there.
A man. Dressed in wide robes of a dark blue cotton, layers overlapping with a white shirt below. His hair was gray and slightly scruffy, much of it bound in a single braid that reached his lower back. A thick beard covered half his face, various braids within, some adorned with colored string. His eyes were bright like none she had seen before, arcane power downright radiating, as if she saw his very soul. She blinked to see with her eyes only, finding light blue pupils looking straight back at her. Wrinkles showed near his eyes and brow, the man wearing thick leather boots, standing without tension as he took her in with interest. No rain fell on his robes or hair.
He could’ve been her grandpa, back when she had been a child. Sixty or perhaps seventy years old, but Ilea knew the truth. This being was ageless. It brimmed with the power of a god.
[Scholar of the Arcane – lvl 1052]
“Another puzzle presents itself before me,” the man spoke, then turned back to look at the Praetorian right next to him. “Quite an interesting development.” A pipe appeared in his hand, a flame coming to life before it set alight the contents. He dragged from the pipe and smiled. “And who might you be?” He spoke, the words meant for Ilea, touching the metal of the Praetorian like someone might appreciate a nice car.
“Lilith of the Accords,” Ilea said, then paused. She looked at him and smiled. “Ilea, nice to meet you. Eregar, I assume.”
He chuckled, then smoked from his pipe. “Right. One of the names. Your Lilith perhaps. Here in Elos. Erik, it’s good to see you, Dragonslayer.” He shook his head then laughed. “Seems a lot has changed over the last few centuries. Sources and the Architect, lifted from the distant past. The Meadow Accords. And a four mark human.” He smiled and looked up at the falling rain.
“Took you a while to get here,” Ilea said.
He pointed his pipe at her, then raised his brows. “That is true.” He smoked again.
“Mr. Anderson, we assumed you could be of help to prevent another possible Extraction. Your knowledge left behind in the Haven has instructed us on how to contact you,” Aki spoke.
“Marvelous. A machine controlled from farther away than I can perceive. Aki, you are truly something special,” Erik spoke and tapped the machine with his free hand. “I will want to hear your story,” he said, looking at the glowing green eyes above. He turned towards Ilea and walked over, offering his hand.
She shook it.
“And you. Ilea. A dragonslayer. That is a feat very few could ever dream of accomplishing,” he spoke then went in for a hug.
Ilea didn’t know how to react. She just lightly tapped his back and looked at Aki, the Praetorian shrugging slightly.
Erik let go and smiled, holding her shoulders as he looked at her. “Marked as a friend to the Fae, and the power I feel from you. Astounding and terrifying. To think a human like you would come along.” He took in a deep breath. “I’m proud of you.”
“That’s… thanks,” Ilea said, gently moving his hands away from her shoulders. “The Architect?” she asked.
“Oh. Yes. Ker Velor. Remember that one… sinister. Just, no heart. A perfectionist, I believe. Of course bent on controlling the very universe. Of the few I’ve seen, he may be the closest one to actually achieve such a goal given a few hundred thousand years.
“It’s difficult to find information on Navuun ancestry, but with Kohr it’s no surprise. A world of strife.” He shook his head. “If only his parents had taught him different.” He smoked from his pipe, the look in his eyes changing somewhat. “If the Architect is truly after another sun in this realm, there is nothing that could stop his plans. He would not use the mesh already present, and finding another one is near impossible. Finding him, even more so.
“Let alone invading his facilities. It would take me to survive such a feat, and there would be hundreds, if not thousands,” Erik spoke. “We would need a tremendous effort to find one of his facilities, and then we would need the help of another Ascended to find the entire mesh. All the while surviving whatever he prepared in there, not triggering any fail saves that would destroy or disconnect the facility, and if that all succeeds, he would start to interfere directly.”
“We’ve come to similar conclusions,” Aki spoke.
“I’ve fought him before,” Ilea said.
“I don’t know how that could’ve happened, but I believe you. And I understand what you are trying to say. I could likely face him too. But Ker Velor will not appear and fight us. He will slaughter the people in our towns, will poison every dungeon. He will destroy the logistics that keeps everything going. No means are beyond a being with no empathy and fueled by purpose, but compared to most everyone else, he has experience, has perfected his tools.”
“Even more reason to remove him from existence,” Ilea said.
“It would certainly be an overall improvement to all life everywhere. Finding him and destroying him, that may very well be beyond even killing a dragon. But then, you are proficient in space magic.” Erik said and thought. “This is quite a predicament.”
“We are far into preparations already,” Aki said. “Your knowledge may bring additional clarity and help. If you are willing to assist in this endeavor.”
Erik looked at them in turn, dragged from his pipe, then grinned. “From what I read and saw, I always thought him unbeatable. Perhaps not the worst of the Ascended, but certainly the most prepared. I’m interested to see what you two and those Accords have cooked up. Breaking those seals, you must’ve brought quite an assortment of beings together.” He smoked again and smiled. “And this is about Elos. My home realm. I will do what I can to help.”
Sounds like he’s going on an afternoon stroll.
Ilea watched him, trying to discern his Classes, his power.
“Then we will move north, for you to meet the Meadow. We have to ask you some questions to make sure we can trust you. Is that acceptable?”
Erik laughed. “Refreshing. Lead the way, I assume it will be a long flight.”
“Through here,” Ilea said and opened a gate to the northern landscape. “Mind the lightning.”
The old man stepped closer to the space magic, reached in his hand and pulled it out again. He repeated the process another three times before he looked at her. “Can we talk later? I would love to see what another four mark human can do. Quite exciting to meet you. A first, really.”
“I’m interested in a bout as well,” Ilea said with a smile.
His eyes went wide. “Oh no. Nonono. Not a bout! I’m too old for that. Far too old. And you have slain a dragon! Proof enough that I could not stand my ground. But we may exchange pointers.” He paused before walking through the gate. “Will this upset my stomach?”
“I don’t think so. Or nobody had the guts to tell me before,” she said.
“Yeah. I suppose talking back at the four mark is not encouraged. A curse sometimes, though there are spells that help,” he said and winked, walking through the gate with casual steps.
She looked at Aki, but the machine waved her off.
“I won’t use this one to talk to him. The Meadow is informed, and has asked for you to join. Just in case,” he said.
“I’ll be there in a second,” Ilea said when she saw movement in the distance. An entire group of armored people flying and running through the fields, ahead of them a singular woman clad in dark green scale armor. “Wait. Give me another minute or two. I assume Eregar hasn’t caused chaos yet in the north?”
“He has set up a small office near your anchor. Introductions with the Meadow are underway. We want to make sure he is not a danger to the Accords or the beings of Elos before we integrate him into our plans.”
“Great,” Ilea said and closed her gate, watching the armored woman land with an impressive impact.
She looked around before her eyes locked with Ilea’s. “You.”
“Me. Good to see you, Helena,” Ilea said and waved.
Helena didn’t approach. “What have you done with the Founder?”
“Oh. Right. The Lily. He’s being interviewed by the Meadow. Maybe he can help with our little problem.”
“That ludicrous tale of a sun plucked from the skies?” Helena asked, then sighed. Taking off her helmet, she glanced between the Praetorian and Ilea. “A dragonslayer, huh. How was it?”
Ilea blinked, then smiled. “Pretty crazy.”
“I couldn’t imagine. He’s working with you all, despite all the creatures you harbor?”
“I think because of it,” Ilea said.
“No. No I can’t believe that. But… if those claims are really true… about the sun.” She bit her lip and shook her head. “You are a member of the Lily still, despite everything. If this is a threat on the scale your people have described, I will offer to work with the Accords.” Helena glanced at Aki. “Send your representatives to Myrefield, if you wish to discuss possible options.” She looked at Ilea. “You win. I cannot compete with four marks and a dragon corpse displayed above Ravenhall.”
“I’m happy to try your next set of teas and cakes. I wonder if any could be enough to kill divinity,” Ilea said.
Helena snorted, her small army of assassins landing nearby, most of them using illusions and light magic to hide. “You will put me out of business.”
Ilea smiled. “I thought there would always be a need for assassins.”
Helena gestured to the Praetorian. She sighed and crossed her arms. “A four mark.” Shaking her head, she turned to leave.
“Maybe you should focus on pastries instead,” Ilea sent.
Helena didn’t look back. “We’ve been doing that for months. Don’t think I’ll slide into irrelevancy. Because I won’t.”
“I’m sure,” Ilea said.
“You better be! If killing is going out of style, I’ll conquer clothing and food instead.”
Ilea smiled before she stepped through a new gate. From rain to arcane storms. I suppose that’s one way to win against an assassin queen. I hope she’s smart enough to go through with the change.
“Claire, can you secure investments in anything food? Helena might be making a move,” she sent through her mark.
“Hah. She’ll find it difficult to compete. But if she wants a fight, she will get it,” Claire sent back.
Ilea wondered what Helena’s goals would be, but she was almost certain the woman wouldn’t go as far as Elizabeth. She had issues with the Accords, but she would have to find her way in this new world. With the gates, clinging on to specism would become increasingly difficult from a logical perspective. Seeing the machines built by dwarves, the magic wielded by Dark Ones and Mava. But then she assumed someone like Helena might see that as confirmation that humanity has to fight back and isolate instead of seeking cooperation.
We’ll see how it goes in the future, Ilea thought. She had views on Helena and her business, but she could see the complex reality of having someone like her in the position she was in. Might even be beneficial for the world at large to work on my ties with the Lily, or get someone else in who could talk to the people in charge.
She focused back on the moment, when a bolt of lightning crashed into a set of bright barriers. Two of them in fact. One golden and one a bright blue.
Erik sat at a beautiful and massive wood table, the legs reinforced with steel contraptions that made sure the thing was even on the northern grounds. His chair looked modern even compared to what Ilea remembered from Earth, the material not leather but something that looked synthetic. He laughed and pointed in the direction of Hallowfort right after the barriers had stopped the lightning.
“Beautiful execution! The mesh of a true master. No inconsistencies, angled perfectly against the ground, and the color!” He stood up and clapped a few times, then looked at Ilea. “Oh! Ilea, you have arrived. Solved that squabble with the assassin’s guild?”
Ilea looked at the scene and thought herself stuck in some sci-fi movie where office equipment was placed in an empty hellscape. Then again, she had taken a lava bath in Kohr, so perhaps this was more normal.
“Helena, of the Golden Lily. You know her I presume?” she said, not hiding how she felt about the whole thing.
“I remember Maureen introduced her to me. Young, incredibly ambitious, but smart too. She didn’t know who I was back then, and still she listened to me, offered her views and time. To think she’s grown to become the leader of such a massive organization. Impressive, to say the least,” he spoke.
“And she’s continuously interfered with the Accords,” Aki spoke. “Due to her views on most of our allies. The Golden Lily is supposed to protect humanity, and to keep chaos and war from destroying the Plains.”
Erik nodded and leaned against his table. “A problem. I admit. There was a lot going on after the Olym Arcena broke. People needed stability. They had to focus on their own. Their families, their cities, their countries. It would’ve been impossible to bring those in power together without a common goal. Stability for the Plains, and for humanity, that was what we offered, and many found such a thing compelling. I do not excuse any actions taken by individuals or by the Lily itself. I was there when the original Order was founded. The Blue Rose then, but there were a few more iterations throughout the millennia.”
“Why not stick with one?” Ilea asked.
“Oh, they killed each other. Massive wide scale conflicts. One of those conflicts wiped out the Empire of Havat. From the maps. Incredible efforts and a genocide worse than many I’ve seen before. I believe that region is called Nipha by now. I merely tried to find solutions and offer insight, but we remain human. I’m interested in the developments that led to the formation and acceptance of the Accords. If such an acceptance truly exists. I have yet to talk to those living in its cities.”
“Citizens of the Accords experience more wealth and opportunities than ever seen before. Mostly due to an addition of teleportation gates, the availability of high level healers and enchanters, and the security provided by the former Taleen army,” the Meadow said.
“I never did manage to convince the Taleen of cooperation. How did you do it?” Erik asked.
“We didn’t do anything. They pretty much did it to themselves,” Ilea said. “Made a massive machine thing called the One without Form, had it defend them and destroy Elven kind. It decided to imprison the entirety of the Taleen people in an underground city, thus protecting them, and it has since fought a war against the Domains, one we managed to bring to an end.”
“And I’m the new one in charge,” Aki said. “Of the machines that is.”
“Meadow helped crack the problem of teleportation gates before that however,” Ilea added.
“I did not yet ask what the Meadow actually is, and how it got to this realm,” Erik said.
“Found it in another realm where it wanted to save the last of the awakened beings it had harbored. I managed to bring it back here where it started to provide stability in this region. Now the Meadow and Aki are essentially the pillars on which the Accords are built. Without them, I imagine the same iterations of colored flowers would follow in the centuries to come,” Ilea said.
Erik smiled wide as he looked at her. He huffed and nodded to himself.
“What?” Ilea asked.
“Oh I do look quite self satisfied right now,” he said. “You did what I could not.”
“I had my part to play, but most of it is happenstance. Being in the right place at the right time,” Ilea said.
“That may be the case. But I’ll make up my own mind,” Erik said. “I don’t assume you’re done with your questions?” He glanced at the Executioner nearby.
The silver machine shook its head.

I will go into more detail on the release post when the time comes, but it’s been enlightening to work with my editor Brook. I had tried to clean up and edit those early sections of Azarinth a few times in the past four years but it always felt overwhelming. I needed help, and I got it.
Of course, the core story elements and characters were present, but to me, a lot of it felt unfocused, the characterization shallow, the world still in its infancy, without any of the worldbuilding shining through (because I made a lot of shit up on the spot). Let alone my technical writing skill. I suppose there was a charm to it at the time, back when Royalroad wasn’t quite as competitive and massive as it is today, but for a real book release, I wanted it to be cleaned up big time.
Ilea is the same Ilea that we know, but she feels more grounded to me now, her actions and decisions make more sense, as do her emotions. Same for many of the other characters and the world itself. The readability and flow both in technical aspects and pacing should be improved a ton as well, without losing the chill/journey vibe that I really like. And I made sure to put in a bunch of easter eggs for anyone who’s read the original version already :).
Oh, and the audiobook for the first book is done as well. Andrea Parsneau essentially became Ilea for this one, so if you’re interested in that, stay tuned. I can’t share any release date info on that yet as we are still working a couple of things out.
So yeah, book 1 is up for preorder now. If you do get it, I’d love to hear what you think :).
Thank you for reading, as always.
